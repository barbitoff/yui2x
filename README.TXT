3. Directory structure

All source files are situated under /src subdirectory of the project. Under the 
/test subdirectory you can find test pages and script files where the usage of 
additions is demonstrated. Test file naming convention is the following: if 
library file from /src/ subdirectory is named "a.js", test html-page for it will
be named "a-test.html", and test jacascript filed, used by that html-page - 
"a-test.js".
